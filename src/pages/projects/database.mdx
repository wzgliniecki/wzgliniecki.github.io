## Project Overview

**Clone DB** is a database implementation built entirely in **Python**, inspired by two tutorials that originally provided insights into creating a database in **C**. This project aims to replicate the functionality of **SQLite**, but with added capabilities for modern web interactions.

The goal is to create a lightweight, custom database that is capable of handling connections via **WebSockets**, while being compatible with both **WSGI** and **ASGI** protocols. These protocols allow for synchronous and asynchronous communication between the server and clients, making Clone DB highly scalable for web applications. 

Clone DB is based on two main tutorials:

1. [CStack DB Tutorial (Part 1)](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/parts/part1.html): This comprehensive guide covers the fundamentals of building a simple database engine in C.
2. [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/): This resource teaches network programming and provides insights into implementing socket-based communication, which is a core part of Clone DB's WebSocket support.


### Key Features

- **WebSocket Support:** Provides real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the database. Ideal for applications requiring live data updates or continuous interactions.
- **WSGI and ASGI Compatibility:** Supports both synchronous (WSGI) and asynchronous (ASGI) Python web frameworks, offering flexibility for various server-side architectures.
- **SQL Database Engine:** Implements core database functionalities similar to SQLite, including storing, retrieving, and managing data in a compact, file-based format.
